# Metro Roulette

Development API is available via the following link: http://metroroulette-env.eba-nkjqcn2w.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

Detailed information on creating API calls can be found in the 'metroroulette' directory README

The front-end is also available via the following link: https://main.d2rnn77bs81b4a.amplifyapp.com/

As of 7/5/2023, the front end is not connected to the backend due to HTTPS certification difficulties. Any advice is appreciated.
